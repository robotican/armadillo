espeak_ros
======================================

This ROS package wraps the espeak library for text-to-speech.

It was developed on Ubuntu 12.04 and tested on ROS Groovy/Hydro.

The original source code of the sole node within this package has 
been copied from https://github.com/Teknoman117/linbot.

Although the source file has no mention of authorship at all, I
credit Nathaniel Lewis for sharing (and likely writing) the code.
